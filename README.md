# philosophy

I try to follow these ideas as much as i can:

- using free/open source software.
- using terminal-based applications.
- using msys2 for development base and scoop for installing any other packages.
- avoid using software from microsoft like vscode, terminal, etc.. use more free alternative (Alacritty, Neovim) or compile linux versions with msys2.

## Tools 🛠️

While this configuration does prepare a great many tools, it revolves primarily around the following:

- 📝 [Neovide](https://neovide.dev/)
- ✏️ [Neovim](https://neovim.io)
- 🐠 [Nushell](nushell/nushell)
- 💻 [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/)
- 🔠 [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)

### Miscellaneous Other Tools 🎒

- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat): A cat clone.
- [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/): Enforce some text styles.
- [eza](https://eza.rocks/): A modern, maintained replacement for ls.
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd): Fast, user-friendly find.
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf): Command-line fuzzy finder.
- [delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta): Syntax highlighting pager.
- [lazydocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker): Container management TUI.
- [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit): The best git interface outside emacs.
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep): Amazing search tool.
- [starship](https://starship.rs/): Customizable prompt.
- [xh](https://github.com/ducaale/xh): Friendly tool for sending http requests.
- [yazi](https://yazi-rs.github.io/): Simple file manager.
- [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide): A smarter cd command. Supports all major shells.

## for future

- i don't want to rely on supply chain. building software directly the pc is the best/safest way.(so i will ditch scoop | winget in future)
- it's better to replace c/c++ software with rust.
- In some cases it's better to use GUI applications.(like web-browsers)

## Install packages

**Change Execution Policy**

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

```powershell
